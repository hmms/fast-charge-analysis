matplotlib based python script to analyse csv file with charging data

Notes:
1. data collected using LTC2943+arduino and 0.1Ohm 1% shunt on the Charger side 
2. Original Samsung Adaptive Fast Charger was used for the tests
3. This data was not acquired on the battery side as it was harder to instrument without permanently damaging the end device
4. This data does not take into consideration the 'magic' happening on the battery side 

Results: ![Results](results.jpeg?raw=true "Fast Charging in Action")
