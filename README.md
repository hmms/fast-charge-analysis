matplotlib based python script to analyse csv file with charging data

Notes:
1. data collected using LTC2943 [Breakout board thanks to zapta](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/HUri2i6R)
+[ATmega328 Xplained Mini from Atmel/Microchip](http://www.atmel.com/tools/mega328p-xmini.aspx?tab=overview) and 0.024Ohm 1% shunt resistor on the Charger side 
2. Original [Samsung Adaptive Fast Charger](http://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/mobile-accessories/phones/adaptive-fast-charging-wall-charger-detachable-microusb-usb-cable-white-ep-ta20jweusta/) was used for the tests
3. This data was not acquired on the battery side as it was harder to instrument without permanently damaging the end device
4. This data does not take into consideration the 'magic' happening on the battery side 
5. Firmware with complete instructions coming soon, I'll link it in here once it's ready


Results: ![Results](results.jpeg?raw=true "Fast Charging in Action")
